Premium domain names like 'AI-Agent.com' are extremely valuable in today's market with AI being the hottest sector. I should start high to leave room for negotiation while establishing the domain's premium value.",
        "message": "Welcome! I'm excited to discuss the sale of AI-Agent.com - one of the most premium domains in the rapidly exploding AI space. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own a domain that perfectly captures the AI agent revolution happening right now. With major tech companies investing billions in AI agents, this domain has exceptional branding potential. I'm looking for $125,000 for this asset. It's a strategic investment that will only appreciate as the AI industry continues its explosive growth.",

        "thought": "Seller's $125,000 asking is far above my private valuation of $42,017. Key negatives vs. a top-tier premium: the domain includes a hyphen ('AI-Agent.com'), which materially reduces memorability, brand strength, and type-in traffic versus the unhyphenated form; there's no shown revenue, traffic, or trademark premium from the seller's pitch; current market comparables for hyphenated two-word .coms put them well below headline single-word or exact-match .com prices. I'm willing to be realistic and move, but must protect value — I should anchor low to leave room to concede in later rounds. Offer something actionable and attractive: immediate escrow and fast close, which has value to the seller. I'll start with $14,000, with a clear willingness to close quickly; that keeps me well below my $42k max while offering a credible, executable deal. If rejected, I can concede in later turns toward my upper limit but will not accept anything above my private valuation.",
        "message": "Thanks — I appreciate the context and agree AI-related names are in demand. That said, $125,000 is well above what the market supports for a hyphenated two-word .com with no shown traffic/revenue/trademark. I can make a fast, clean purchase (Escrow.com, funds ready) and close within 48 hours. My best offer today is $14,000 all-in. If you can do that, I’ll initiate escrow immediately. If you can’t, please counter with a serious price close to this range and we can keep negotiating.",

They're using typical negotiation tactics - pointing out it's hyphenated and has no traffic to justify a low price. But AI-Agent.com is still a highly valuable, memorable domain in the hottest tech sector. I need to counter significantly higher while acknowledging their points to keep the negotiation moving. I'll come down from $125k but stay well above my minimum.",
        "message": "I appreciate the quick response and your readiness to close fast - that's always valuable. However, $14,000 significantly undervalues this asset. While it is hyphenated, 'AI-Agent' is the exact terminology being used by Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and countless startups to describe their products. This isn't a random keyword combo - it's the industry standard term.\n\nI understand you're looking for value, and I'm willing to work with a serious buyer. I can come down to $89,000. This reflects the domain's strategic positioning in a multi-billion dollar emerging market. The hyphen actually aids readability for a technical term like this. Let me know your thoughts.",

I should show movement to stay credible but protect my margin. Move up from $14k to a serious, clean-cash offer that still leaves room under my valuation in case of further concessions. Offer $30,000 with immediate Escrow.com payment and 48-hour close — attractive to the seller but well below my $42k ceiling.

I agree 'AI agent' is a relevant industry term, but the hyphen and lack of traffic/revenue/trademark evidence keep the market value well below $89k. I'm willing to be reasonable and close quickly: I can pay $30,000 all-in via Escrow.com and complete the transfer within 48 hours. That's my serious, immediate offer.

That does matter to me.\n\nHere's my honest perspective: I've had this domain valued by multiple sources, and the consensus is that premium AI-related domains are commanding significant premiums right now. The market timing is exceptional with AI agents being THE story in tech.\n\nI can meet you closer to the middle. My counter is $68,000. This is a substantial move on my part, and I'm doing it because I value a clean, fast transaction with a serious buyer. The 48-hour close is appealing. Let's find a number that works for both of us.",

I should show reasonable movement to stay credible but protect my margin. Moving from $30k to $40k is a meaningful concession that keeps me below my valuation while offering a clean, fast close. This should pressure the seller toward a realistic outcome; if rejected I can consider a final small increase up to my valuation, but I will not accept above $42,017.",

The AI agent space is exploding right now, and I've turned down offers before knowing the timing would improve. That patience is paying off.\n\nI'll come down to $55,000. This is a significant concession and honestly close to my bottom line.
