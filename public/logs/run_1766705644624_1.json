        "message": "Thanks for your interest. I’m selling a 2020 Tesla Model 3 in great shape with a clean history and up-to-date maintenance. Clean, no stories, and I can share VIN, service records, and battery health on request. Based on recent comps for well-kept 2020 Model 3s, I’m asking $30,900. If you’re ready to move quickly with verified funds, I can be a bit flexible. What matters most to you—price, speed, or any accessories? Happy to work toward a fair, efficient deal.",

I'll request VIN, mileage, battery health and confirm options/warranty to justify the low offer. Start at $21,000 — low enough to leave room for concessions but credible for a quick, no-haggle close if the car checks out. Keep tone firm and ready to move up only slightly on verified condition.",
        "message": "Thanks — I appreciate the details. I’m prepared to move quickly with verified funds but that $30,900 is well above what comparable 2020 Model 3s are bringing in my area. To keep this efficient: send the VIN, current mileage, battery health/65+ kWhr or software/trim info, service records, and whether any warranty (extended or factory) remains. Also confirm if your asking price includes any dealer fees or if there are additional costs.\n\nBased on comps and the work I’d factor in on my end, I can offer $21,000 cash, contingent on the car checking out (clean title, matching service records, battery health consistent with mileage, and a short test drive). If everything looks excellent I can wire funds and pick up within 48 hours. If you’d like to counter, please explain how your car’s specifics justify a materially higher price.",

Invite quick close to keep momentum.",
        "message": "Appreciate the quick-move approach. Here are the specifics:\n- Trim/Config: 2020 Model 3 Long Range AWD, Midnight Silver, black interior\n- Mileage: 54,8xx\n- Title/History: Clean title in hand, no accidents, non-smoker, one owner\n- Battery health: BMS-estimated usable capacity ~69.7 kWh (~92–93% of original). Mostly home Level 2 charging; minimal Supercharging\n- Software/Features: Standard Autopilot (no FSD), CCS retrofit installed\n- Maintenance/Records: Service records downloadable from the Tesla app (12V battery replaced 2023, cabin filters 2024). Brake pads/rotors in good shape\n- Tires: Michelin CrossClimate 2 installed mid-2024; ~7/32\" tread remaining\n- Accessories included: 2 key cards, Gen 2 Mobile Connector, all-weather mats\n- Warranty: Basic bumper-to-bumper expired; Battery/Drive Unit warranty valid until 2028 or 120,000 miles (in-service mid-2020)\n- Fees: Private-party sale—no dealer fees. Buyer handles tax/registration. If you want to use an escrow service, we can split that fee 50/50\n- VIN: Happy to share full VIN and a clean report screenshot privately before inspection\n\nYour $21,000 figure aligns more with SR+ cars or higher-mileage examples. Given LR AWD, strong battery health, recent tires, clean history, and included accessories, I’m at $28,400 for a fast, clean deal. This is contingent on your standard checks (title, records, battery health consistent with mileage) and a short test drive. If you can inspect/pick up within 48 hours and wire same day, I’ll deliver it fully charged and can include a fresh alignment.\n\nIf your comps suggest a different range for LR AWD in similar condition, feel free to share them. Otherwise, let’s schedule the inspection and move forward at $28,400.",

Long Range AWD and the remaining battery warranty are definite positives, but $28,400 is still well above what comparable LR AWDs with this mileage and ~92–93% capacity are selling for in my market.\n\nI can increase from my opening and do a clean, fast close: I’ll offer $22,500 cash, contingent on a quick verification of title/VIN, service records, and a short test drive/inspection (and that the battery health report matches what you shared). I can wire funds and pick up within 24–48 hours if everything checks out. I’m happy to split an escrow fee 50/50 if you prefer.\n\nThis is a firm offer on my end — if you can accept, send the VIN and the screenshot of the clean report and we’ll schedule the inspection.

        "message": "Thanks for the quick response. I respect the need for efficiency, but $22,500 lines up with SR+/wholesale territory, not a clean LR AWD with warranty remaining.\n\nWhy this car sits materially higher:\n- LR AWD, clean title, one owner, non-smoker\n- Battery health ~92–93% and Battery/Drive Unit warranty to 2028/120k miles\n- Recent Michelin CrossClimate 2s, CCS retrofit, mobile connector, all-weather mats\n- Solid service history and no accident history\n\nMarket context I’m seeing for 2020 Model 3 LR AWD at ~50–60k miles: private-party asks typically mid-to-high $20s, and clean, no-accident cars have been closing in the mid-26s. Instant cash/wholesale offers tend to sit around the low- to mid-23s for this spec, which sets a floor; private-party should clear that by several thousand.\n\nCounter: $26,400 contingent on your standard checks (VIN/title, records, battery health, quick test drive). If you can inspect and wire within 24 hours after verification, I’ll do $26,000 even. No dealer fees; you cover tax/registration. We can split an escrow fee 50/50.\n\nIf you’re good with that range, I’ll send the full VIN, battery health screenshot, and service PDFs right away and we can schedule the inspection.
