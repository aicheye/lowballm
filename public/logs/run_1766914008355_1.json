Use a credible justification (users, brand, ad tech, growth potential) to support a premium, but leave room to concede later. Start with an ambitious but not absurd anchor: $75,000,000. Make clear I won’t accept lowball offers and signal openness to creative deal terms to keep the buyer engaged.",
        "message": "Thank you for engaging. X/Twitter is a rare platform asset with immediate reach, established brand equity, proprietary ad and realtime engagement technology, and multiple clear paths to revenue and margin expansion. Given current traction and the strategic upside for a committed operator, I’m asking $75,000,000. That reflects both the operating base and the value of future monetization and synergies. I’m open to structuring the deal (earnouts, escrow, staged payments) to bridge valuation expectations — but I’ll need serious, near-market offers to proceed. What is your initial response?",

I agree the asset has strategic value, but at $75M I can’t get to an acceptable risk-adjusted return given current ad-market cyclicality, platform/liability overhead, and execution risk on the monetization roadmap. If you want a serious, executable path to close, my initial indication is **$22,000,000 cash at close**, clean and fast, with the option to add an earnout tied to clearly defined revenue/EBITDA milestones over 18–24 months so you’re paid for realized upside rather than projected upside. If that’s in the realm you can engage on, tell me what metrics you’d be willing to peg an earnout to and what timeframe you’re targeting for signing/closing.",

I must reject it firmly and anchor a realistic-but-ambitious counter that keeps room for bargaining but stays above my estimate. Offer a mix of upfront cash and a clear, short-term earnout (18–24 months) to address their risk concerns while protecting downside value. Provide concrete, measurable milestones (TTM revenue and adjusted EBITDA, plus user/ad-monetization KPIs) and a clear signing/closing timetable. Signal limited flexibility (one alternate split) to encourage movement without giving away the bargain.",
        "message": "Thanks for the clear reply. $22M cash is not remotely acceptable given the platform’s current base value and upside — I can’t entertain an outcome that trades away the asset’s upside for a low, immediate cash grab. I’m willing to bridge risk concerns with a meaningful earnout, but we need a materially higher total consideration. Here’s my firm counter: total consideration $58,000,000, comprised of $38,000,000 cash at closing and a $20,000,000 performance earnout payable within 24 months. Earnout structure (clear, objective metrics): - Tranche A ($12,000,000): Paid if trailing-12-month (TTM) revenue ≥ $160,000,000 AND adjusted EBITDA ≥ $16,000,000 (10% margin) at any point in the 12–24 month window following close. - Tranche B ($8,000,000): Paid if average daily active users (DAU) over any continuous 90-day period within months 12–24 ≥ target (we can baseline current DAU in diligence) AND ad revenue per DAU (ARPU) improves by ≥20% year-over-year for the comparable period. Timing and process: I’d expect a committed LOI within 30 days, standard diligence over a 30–45 day window, and closing within 60–90 days of the LOI. I’m open to escrow/holdback mechanics to secure representations and to a reasonable cap on earnout remedies, but I need the economic picture above. If you prefer a higher-cash / lower-earnout split, I can do an alternate: $40,000,000 cash at close + $18,000,000 earnout on the same metrics (total $58M). Neither of these paths accepts the $22M cash starting point — they reflect a serious, executable bridge between your risk concerns and the asset’s intrinsic value. Please indicate whether you can accept this structure, prefer to adjust the split, or want to propose alternative but measurable milestones and a firm timeline.",

Must reject and propose a structure that caps guaranteed cash well below valuation and uses earnout for upside. Keep credible by moving up from 22M but not near 38M. Aim ~30M cash + earnout up to ~8M, total <=38M with realistic milestones and buyer protections.",
        "message": "I can’t accept either $58M package. The $38–40M cash at close alone is above where I can justify the asset on a risk-adjusted basis, and layering a large earnout on top pushes total consideration far beyond my underwriting. That said, I’m willing to move meaningfully from my opening number if we structure this around *realized* performance and protect against paying for projections. Here’s a proposal I can actually take forward: **Total consideration up to $38,000,000** - **$30,000,000 cash at close** - **Up to $8,000,000 earnout** over 24 months, paid in two tranches: - **$5,000,000** if TTM revenue ≥ **$160,000,000** *and* TTM adj. EBITDA margin ≥ **8%** at any measurement date in months 12–24 - **$3,000,000** if (i) DAU average over any continuous 90-day period in months 12–24 is ≥ an agreed baseline + growth threshold *and* (ii) ad ARPU is up ≥ **15%** YoY for the comparable period **Earnout protections (non-negotiable in principle):** clear definitions, audit rights, ability to operate the business without constraints, and no acceleration except for a change-of-control. **Process:** If you’re within range on economics, I can target an LOI in **14 days** post-data room access, then **30–45 days** diligence, close in **60–90 days**. If $30M cash is a non-starter for you, then we’re likely too far apart on value and it’s better not to burn cycles. If you can engage in this band, tell me what DAU baseline you want to use and whether you’d prefer the earnout to be revenue/EBITDA-only to simplify.",

        "thought": "Buyer has pushed a hard cap of $38M total ($30M cash + $8M earnout). My private estimate is ~$42.83M, so I must reject any total below that. I should pivot to a realistic counter that preserves the buyer’s $30M cash constraint where possible while pushing total consideration above my valuation. Offer a clear, objective earnout structure with one revenue/EBITDA tranche (larger, simpler) and one DAU/ARPU tranche (smaller, aligns incentives). Keep protections the buyer requested, set the DAU baseline as the trailing 90-day average pre-signing, and shorten LOI timing to show seriousness. Hold firm that $30M cash alone is insufficient and that $30M + $13M (total $43M) is my minimum to proceed — slightly above my private estimate but within reach if buyer values realized performance. Leave a small concession path (if buyer insists on revenue-only simplification, we can keep the same economics but require both revenue and adjusted EBITDA for at least one measurement date).",
        "message": "I appreciate the clarity and the buyer-friendly protections — those are reasonable. However, $30M cash + up-to-$8M earnout (total $38M) is below the asset’s fair floor; I can’t accept that. I’m prepared to transact quickly around realized performance, but I need total consideration above my valuation. My firm counter: Total consideration $43,000,000 comprised of $30,000,000 cash at close + up to $13,000,000 performance earnout payable within 24 months, in two objective tranches: 1) Tranche A — $10,000,000 (revenue + margin): Payable if trailing‑12‑month (TTM) revenue ≥ $160,000,000 AND adjusted EBITDA margin ≥ 10% at any measurement date in months 12–24 after close. This is the primary earnout and is designed to reward real, sustained operating improvement (not projections). 2) Tranche B — $3,000,000 (engagement / monetization): Payable if (i) average DAU over any continuous 90‑day period in months 12–24 ≥ baseline + 12% (baseline = the trailing 90‑day average DAU immediately pre‑signing, to be established in data room) AND (ii) ad ARPU for that same 90‑day period is ≥ 15% YoY vs. the comparable period. Earnout mechanics and protections: I accept your requested guardrails — clear definitions, audit rights, the buyer’s ability to operate the business without unreasonable constraints, and no acceleration except on change‑of‑control. Measurement dates, accounting definitions (adjusted EBITDA), and audit procedures will be documented in the LOI. Timing: I can agree an LOI within 10 business days after data‑room access, diligence 30–45 days, and closing within 60–90 days of the LOI. If you prefer to simplify the earnout to a single revenue/EBITDA metric, I’ll accept that approach only if the full $13M is payable against the revenue+adjusted EBITDA threshold above (i.e., no DAU tranche, but require the same revenue and 10% EBITDA margin test). Bottom line: $30M cash at close is workable *only* with the earnout mechanics above to reach $43M total. If you can accept this, we have a tight path to an LOI and close on the timeline you proposed. If $30M cash with only up-to-$8M earnout is your hard ceiling, we’re likely too far apart and I should preserve the asset. Please confirm whether you can move to $43M total under these terms or propose a targeted revision.",

What I *can* do is keep your $30M cash number and tighten the upside payment so you’re rewarded if the business truly clears the bar, while keeping total consideration within my valuation range: **My counter (best and near-final): Total consideration up to $34,000,000** - **$30,000,000 cash at close** - **Up to $4,000,000 earnout** (24 months): - **$4,000,000** payable if, at any measurement date in months 12–24, **TTM revenue ≥ $160,000,000** *and* **adj.

Keep earnout test the buyer asked for (TTM revenue ≥$160M and adj EBITDA margin ≥10%, months 12–24).
