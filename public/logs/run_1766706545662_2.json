        "message": "Hello! I'm looking to sell my 2020 Tesla Model 3. It's in fantastic condition, has been very well cared for, and includes several premium features. Given its condition and current market demand for reliable EVs, I'm asking $31,500.",

        "message": "Hi there! Thanks for reaching out about the Model 3. I've been researching the used EV market quite a bit, and while I appreciate that you've taken good care of it, $31,500 seems quite high for a 2020 Model 3 with the current market conditions. I've seen similar models going for considerably less. I'd be willing to offer $18,500. I'm a serious buyer ready to move quickly if we can agree on a fair price.",

I'll drop to $29,800 to signal I'm open to negotiating, but emphasize that $18,500 isn't a realistic starting point.",
        "message": "I appreciate the quick response, but $18,500 is significantly below the current market value and even below what a dealership would offer for a trade-in. This car is in excellent condition and still holds great range and performance. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go that low. I'm prepared to come down to $29,800 to find some common ground.",

I need to move up somewhat to show good faith, but still keep plenty of room. I'll increase my offer by about $1,500 to $20,000. This shows I'm serious but maintains my position that the asking price is too high.",
        "message": "I appreciate you coming down a bit. I understand you believe strongly in your car's value, and I respect that. However, the used EV market has softened quite a bit recently, and there's a lot of inventory available. Taking into account typical depreciation for a 2020 model and the current market dynamics, I can move up to $20,000. That's a significant jump from my initial offer and reflects my genuine interest in making this work.",

        "message": "I understand you're looking for a deal, but $20,000 is still far below the reality of the current market for a Model 3 in this condition. Between the battery health, the software updates, and the premium features, this car offers much more value than a base model. I'll come down to $28,400 to show I'm serious about closing the gap, but I can't entertain offers that don't reflect the car's actual worth.",

I need to continue pushing while showing flexibility. I'll increase my offer by about $1,200 to $21,200. This demonstrates continued good faith movement while keeping me well under my valuation. We're at turn 3 of 6, so I have some room to work with still.",
        "message": "I hear you on the premium features and battery health - those are definitely important factors. But I've done my homework and even well-maintained 2020 Model 3s are trading in a lower range than you're asking. The market has shifted with Tesla's price cuts on new vehicles affecting used values significantly. I can come up to $21,200. That's over $2,700 more than where I started, and represents a fair price for both of us given current market conditions. I'm ready to close this deal if we can get closer.",

If they continue this trend, they won't even reach my floor by the end of the negotiation. I need to signal that their current range is unacceptable while making a slightly smaller concession to show I am firming up. I will counter with $27,200, which is a $1,200 drop from my previous offer, matching their last increment.",
        "message": "While I acknowledge the shifts in the new car market, those price cuts primarily affected the highest-end trims and new inventory. For a well-maintained 2020 Model 3 in the used market, $21,200 is still closer to wholesale or auction pricing rather than a fair private sale price. I've already come down over $4,000 from my starting point. I can move to $27,200, but we are still quite far apart, and I cannot justify selling the car for the figures you're suggesting.",

We're still $4,345 apart from my valuation of $22,855. I'm at turn 4 of 6, so I need to make meaningful progress. I should increase my offer more substantially to show I'm serious, but I need to stay under my valuation. I'll go to $22,000 - this is a jump of $800 and puts me within striking distance of my max while still leaving some buffer. This is getting close to my limit and I need to signal that.",
        "message": "Look, I appreciate that you've moved quite a bit from your starting point. Let me be more direct with you - I've set aside a budget for this purchase based on extensive market research, and I'm getting close to my ceiling. I can offer $22,000, which is another significant jump on my end. That's a fair private sale price that accounts for the car's condition while reflecting the reality of where the used Model 3 market sits today. I think we're both reasonable people trying to find common ground here.",

We are at Turn 5, meaning I only have one more chance after this to reach a deal. The buyer's increments are decreasing ($1,500, then $1,200, now $800), suggesting they are nearing their limit. However, their limit is currently below my floor. I need to make it clear that I cannot go as low as $22,000. I will counter with $26,200, which is a $1,000 drop from my previous offer and sits just $782 above my private valuation. This signals I am reaching my absolute limit.",
        "message": "I appreciate your transparency regarding your budget, but even with the market shifts, $22,000 is simply not a figure I can accept. At that price, I would be better off keeping the car or exploring other high-value trade-in options. I've already reduced my price by over $5,000 to meet you. I'm willing to go down to $26,200 as a final gesture to bridge this gap, but that is very close to the lowest I'm prepared to go for a vehicle in this pristine condition.",

I'm at turn 5 of 6 - this is getting critical. The seller at $26,200 is still well above my maximum valuation. Even if I go to my absolute max of $22,855, that's still over $3,300 apart. I need to make one more push but be prepared to walk away. I'll offer $22,500, which is $355 under my valuation, giving me a small margin. This is essentially my final offer - if they can't come down to around $23,000 or below, this deal won't work for me and I should be prepared to walk.",

That's my absolute ceiling based on the research I've done and comparable sales I've tracked. I'm stretching to make this work because I do like the car. But if we can't meet somewhere around this number, I may need to look at other options. I'd rather make a deal with you today, but it has to make sense for both of us.",

I will provide one last firm price that is slightly above my valuation to see if they can bridge the gap, but I will not accept their offer as it stands.",
        "message": "I appreciate your final offer, but $22,500 is simply too far from the car's actual value and my bottom line. This Model 3 is worth significantly more than that, even with current market shifts. My absolute lowest price to close this today is $25,800. If that doesn't work for your budget, I understand, but I'll have to pass and look for other buyers who can better reflect the vehicle's true value.",

Accepting $25,800 would mean I'm paying almost $3,000 more than my market estimate, which violates my core objective. According to my rules, it's better to walk away with no deal (score of 0) than to accept a price that causes me to lose value. I need to politely decline and end negotiations.",

Unfortunately, $25,800 is beyond what I can justify based on my research and budget. We're still about $3,300 apart, and I don't see a path to bridging that gap.
