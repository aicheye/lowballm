The recent $10k–$12k sales you’re citing tend to be either open editions, weaker provenance, or less distinctive artists; this is a true 1/1 with clean history and scarcity that holds value even in softer cycles.\n\nIf you can close quickly, I can come down to $24,900. If you share the specific comps you’re referencing, I’m happy to sanity-check them and see if there’s any additional room—but $11.5k isn’t in the realm for this piece.",

If I go to around $13,500-14,000, that shows I'm serious while still leaving room to negotiate toward something under $17k. I should acknowledge their point about provenance while pushing back on the premium they're asking.",
        "message": "Fair point on provenance differentials - I'll concede that clean 1/1s do command a premium over editions. But the market correction has compressed even quality pieces significantly. The $24,900 range assumes 2021-2022 peak valuations that just aren't holding in current conditions.\n\nI can stretch to $14,000 to reflect the genuine scarcity and provenance you're describing. That's a meaningful jump from my initial offer and accounts for the quality differential. Where does that land for you?",

I'll move up to around $15,500-16,000 to show serious intent while keeping buffer below my max. I should signal I'm getting close to my limit without revealing the exact number.",
