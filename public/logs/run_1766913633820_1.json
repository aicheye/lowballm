This Model 3 has a clean title, zero accident history, and I have all the service records. The tires were replaced last year and have plenty of life left. It's still under Tesla's 8-year battery warranty too. Looking at comparable sales in my area, clean 2020 Model 3s are consistently going for $25k-$28k.
