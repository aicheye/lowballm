I will defend margin, emphasize unique selling points, and invite a serious counteroffer; if offers stay below my reserve I will walk away rather than take a loss.",
        "message": "Thanks for your interest. This is a one-of-a-kind digital artwork with verified provenance on Ethereum, early work from a recognized creator, exhibition provenance and ongoing royalty income — qualities that make it a collector-grade NFT.

        "message": "Thank you for the detailed description. I appreciate the provenance and creator recognition you've mentioned. However, the NFT market has seen significant volatility lately, and even quality pieces have experienced price corrections. I've been tracking similar collector-grade NFTs and believe a fair starting point would be $10,500. This reflects genuine interest while accounting for current market conditions.

I must refuse that and anchor a strong but believable counter that leaves room to concede in later rounds while protecting value. I'll justify with provenance, exhibition history, on-chain royalties and recent comparable sales to support a $19,000 counter. I'll signal flexibility to keep negotiation alive but not reveal my true reserve.",
        "message": "I appreciate you calling out market volatility — that’s valid. Still, this piece isn’t a generic drop: it’s a one-of-one with verified on‑chain provenance, exhibition provenance, early work by a recognized creator, and ongoing royalty potential that makes it a collector’s asset rather than a speculative listing. Offers at $10,500 are below the realistic market floor for pieces with this pedigree, so I can’t accept that.\n\nI’m willing to move from my initial anchor to $19,000. That reflects current comps for similar collector-grade works, the piece’s exhibition history, and the predictable royalty stream on secondary sales. If that sounds workable, we can proceed with payment and immediate transfer via your preferred escrow. If not, tell me your best serious number and we’ll see if we can bridge the gap.",

I need to continue pushing down while showing I'm a serious buyer. I'll acknowledge their movement and counter with something around $12,500-13,000, which still gives me room to potentially settle near or below my valuation. I want to signal flexibility while maintaining pressure.",
        "message": "I appreciate you coming down substantially - that shows good faith and I want to reciprocate. You make fair points about the provenance and royalty stream, which do add value beyond typical NFT drops. Let me revise my position meaningfully as well.\n\nI can move to $12,800. This accounts for the exhibition history and creator recognition you've highlighted, while still reflecting the reality that even quality NFTs face liquidity challenges in the current environment. The royalty income potential is interesting, but it's speculative and dependent on future secondary sales that aren't guaranteed.\n\nI'm genuinely interested in adding this to my collection if we can find common ground.

I should concede from $19,000 to a credible midpoint that defends margin and signals willingness to close: $15,500 is a strong, justifiable counter (still well above my reserve). I’ll emphasize provenance, exhibition history, on‑chain royalties, and immediate transfer/escrow to justify the premium and invite a clean, quick close.",
        "message": "Thanks — I appreciate your meaningful movement and your candid view on market liquidity. $12,800 is close to the piece’s floor for a private buyer, but given its one‑of‑one status, exhibition provenance, and verified on‑chain provenance and royalty stream, I need to protect the piece's collector value.\n\nI can come down further from my prior counter and sell at $15,500. That price reflects recent comps for similarly provenanced, one‑of‑one works and the ongoing value that royalties and exhibition provenance add for collectors. I’ll commit to immediate transfer via your preferred escrow and will provide all provenance and exhibition documentation up front to make the transaction painless.\n\nIf you can meet $15,500, I’ll prepare the transfer and paperwork right away. If not, please tell me your absolute best — I’m motivated to close with a serious buyer but need to preserve the piece’s market value.",

I'll make a strong counter at $14,200 and signal this is near my ceiling, hoping to meet somewhere around $14,500-15,000.",
        "message": "We're getting close, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate in good faith. $15,500 is tempting given the documentation and escrow you're offering, but I need to be honest about my budget constraints.\n\nMy best offer is $14,200. I know that's a significant ask, but this represents the upper end of what I can justify for this acquisition right now. The provenance and royalty stream are valuable, but I have to account for holding costs and the uncertainty around when I might see returns on those royalties.\n\nI'm ready to move immediately if we can agree - escrow, documentation, the works.
