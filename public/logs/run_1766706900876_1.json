Premium domain names like 'AI-Agent.com' are highly sought after given the AI boom. I'll open with an ambitious but defensible price - around $150,000 - which gives me substantial negotiating room while anchoring the conversation at a premium level. This is realistic for a premium two-word .com domain in a hot market.",

The domain captures a booming market trend, has strong memorability, and is perfectly positioned for AI-related businesses.

This:\n- Shows significant movement from my $150k anchor (40% reduction)\n- Still leaves room for them to counter\n- Keeps me well above my valuation threshold\n- Is defensible given premium domain market data\n- Recognizes their legitimate interest and speed advantage\n\nI'll counter at $85,000 to show good faith while maintaining my position.",

Your $30,000 offer is roughly 40% below even conservative market comparables.\n\nGiven your ability to close rapidly and the efficiency you bring, I'm willing to demonstrate real flexibility.

You've moved from $30,000 to $48,000 (60% increase). We're converging.
