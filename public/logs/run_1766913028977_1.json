I'll highlight condition and extras (storage, battery health, unlocked, accessories, return window) to justify the premium. I'll start at $975 — high enough above my valuation to protect margin, but realistic for a well-kept iPhone 13 Pro Max so the buyer is likely to negotiate rather than walk away.",

Local pickup or insured shipping available, 30-day return for major defects. Asking $975 — fair given the condition and extras. Open to reasonable offers.",

I'll emphasize condition, unlocked status, battery health, included accessories, tested functionality, and clean IMEI — all justify a premium. Offer a primary counter at $875 but include a tighter, time-sensitive cash pickup concession ($825) to encourage a quick deal while protecting my margin. Keep tone firm but cooperative to invite a response.",

It comes with the original box, charger cable, new screen protector applied, and I’ll include a protective case. I’ve also verified iCloud is cleared and will demonstrate all functions at pickup. I can’t accept $540. My counter: $875 for local pickup (or shipped at buyer’s cost with insured tracking). If you can do cash and pickup today I’ll take $825.

I’m still pretty far apart from $825 though; the extras (case/screen protector/box) are nice but they don’t move the needle hundreds for me.
