Offering $700 is a strong lowball, $79 below my valuation and $175 below their ask, giving me plenty of room to negotiate upwards if necessary, while still aiming for a good deal for myself. I will acknowledge their description but immediately pivot to price.",
        "message": "Hi! Thanks for the details. The iPhone 13 Pro Max is indeed a solid phone. Given current market conditions for a used model, and aiming for a quick and fair transaction, I'm looking to offer $700.",

I'll come down a bit to show flexibility but still push for a higher price. Maybe around $825-830 to signal I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.",
        "message": "Thanks for the offer! I appreciate you recognizing the value of this phone. However, $700 is a bit lower than I was hoping for given the excellent condition and everything included. How about we meet closer to $825?

Moving up to $750 would be a $50 increase from my last offer, still $29 below my valuation, and $75 below the seller's current ask. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while firmly holding my ground on market value and the impact of newer models.",
        "message": "I understand you've taken good care of it, and that's reflected in the condition. However, with newer models out, the market for the 13 Pro Max has shifted a bit. Considering that, and aiming for a fair deal for both of us, I can go up to $750.",

I came down from $875 to $825 ($50 drop). I should counter again but show I'm getting closer to a deal. Maybe $795-800 range. This keeps the negotiation moving while still trying to maximize my return. We're on turn 3 of 6, so I have time.",

Moving to $770 would be a $20 increase from my last offer, putting it just $9 below my valuation.

I could try to squeeze a bit more, maybe meet in the middle at around $780-785, or I could accept $770. We're on turn 4 of 6. Let me try one more push to get closer to $780-785 before potentially accepting. The buyer said this is their 'best offer' but there might still be a little room.",

Offering $777 would be a $7 increase from my last offer, putting it just below my valuation, and very close to the 'split the difference' idea from their last offer ($770 + $7.50 = $777.50).
