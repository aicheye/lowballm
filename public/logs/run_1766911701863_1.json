I'll start high to leave room for negotiation while establishing the domain's value.",
        "message": "Welcome! I'm excited to discuss the sale of AI-Agent.com - one of the most premium domain names in today's hottest tech sector. This is a category-defining domain that perfectly captures the AI agent revolution we're witnessing. Companies are paying millions to establish their AI presence, and this domain offers instant brand authority. I'm looking for $175,000 for this exceptional asset. Given the explosive growth in AI and the scarcity of premium .com domains in this space, this represents genuine value for any serious player in the AI industry.",

They're trying to frame it as a quick, clean deal to justify a lowball offer. I need to counter strongly but show some flexibility to keep them engaged. I should acknowledge their point about hyphenated domains while emphasizing the unique value of this specific domain in the AI space. I'll come down significantly from my opening to show good faith, but stay well above my valuation.",
        "message": "I appreciate the straightforward approach and the offer of a clean transaction - that's exactly how I like to do business. However, $12,500 significantly undervalues this asset. While I understand the general discount on hyphenated domains, 'AI-Agent' is different - it's not just two random words, it's THE defining term for an entire category that's reshaping every industry. Every major tech company is building AI agents right now. That said, I recognize my opening was ambitious and I want to find a deal that works. I can come down to $95,000.

        "message": "$95,000 is still in a different universe from where I can justify this, even granting that “AI agent” is a hot term. The hyphen materially caps resale and brand adoption (radio test, paid search leakage, email error rates), so I have to price it as a strong-but-niche asset, not a category-killer one-word .com.\n\nIf you want a quick, certain close, I can move to $18,000 all-cash via escrow.com (I cover fees) and we close within 72 hours.

They're framing this as their 'best attempt' but we're only on turn 3 - there's room to negotiate. I need to come down more substantially to show I'm serious about making a deal, but I cannot go below my valuation.

I can see you're a serious buyer who knows what they're doing. Let me make a significant move to show good faith: $68,000.

I need to test if they truly have a ceiling or if there's more flexibility. I should come down again but stay above my valuation floor. Let me try $52,000-55,000 range... wait, that's below my valuation. I need to stay ABOVE $57,042. Let me offer around $58,000-60,000 to protect my margin while showing I'm working toward a deal.

You've been straightforward and professional throughout. I'm going to make one more significant move: $58,500. I'm cutting nearly $10,000 off my last offer because I believe we can get this done.
