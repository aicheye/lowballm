        "message": "Thank you for your interest in our Enterprise SaaS solution. Based on the comprehensive feature set, dedicated support, security compliance, and scalability we offer, our annual contract is priced at $165,000. This includes full implementation support, 24/7 premium customer success, and all enterprise-grade features. I'm confident you'll find this represents excellent value for a solution of this caliber.

This is a typical aggressive opening position. I need to counter with a realistic but competitive offer that anchors the negotiation closer to my valuation. I should acknowledge the value proposition while making it clear this price is outside my acceptable range. A strong counter-offer at around 70% of their ask ($115,500) or my valuation range would signal I'm serious but willing to negotiate. I have 6 turns, so I should be firm but not dismissive.",
        "message": "I appreciate the detailed breakdown of your offering. However, at $165,000, you're positioning this well above market rates for comparable enterprise SaaS solutions. While I recognize the value of your implementation support and 24/7 service, I need to be direct: that price point doesn't align with our budget or competitive market analysis. I'm genuinely interested in working with you, but I need to see this positioned more competitively. Based on functionality, support, and comparable solutions in the market, I'm prepared to open our discussion at $95,000 for the annual contract. This reflects fair value while keeping both parties' interests in mind. Can you work in that range?",

I need to counter firmly but show some flexibility to keep the negotiation moving. I'll come down from $165,000 but stay well above my floor. A counter around $148,000-$150,000 shows I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining strong positioning. This leaves room for further concessions while protecting my margin.",
        "message": "I appreciate your directness and understand budget considerations are important. However, $95,000 significantly undervalues what we're bringing to the table. Our solution includes enterprise-grade security certifications, dedicated implementation specialists, and a support SLA that competitors simply don't match at any price point. That said, I want to find a path forward here. I can come down to $148,000, which reflects a meaningful concession on our part while still honoring the true value of the platform and services included. This is a serious offer that accounts for building a long-term partnership. Where can you meet me?",

This is a reasonable negotiating move, but still $41,166 above my private valuation of $106,834. They're emphasizing differentiation (security certifications, dedicated specialists, SLA guarantees) which has real value, but I need to be realistic about what I can pay. My counter at $95,000 was anchoring, and now I should move toward them but still maintain significant margin. A realistic counter would be around $115,000-$120,000 (still about 7-12% below my valuation to leave room for final concessions). This shows good faith movement while staying within defensible range. I'm on turn 2 of 6, so I have room to negotiate.",
        "message": "I respect the movement to $148,000 and I recognize the genuine differentiators you've outlined—the security certifications and SLA guarantees do carry real value. I'm not trying to underpay for quality; I'm trying to find fair market value. The gap between us is still substantial though. Let me move meaningfully toward your position: I can offer $118,000 annually. This reflects my commitment to making this work while staying within what our financial analysis shows as competitive market rates for enterprise solutions with these specifications. This is a serious offer that respects both the value you deliver and our budget realities. Can we find a deal in this range—perhaps $115,000-$120,000?",

I'll counter at around $135,000-$138,000 to see if I can get them closer to $125,000-$130,000 which would be an even better outcome. I need to show flexibility but not concede too quickly - we still have negotiation room.",

Here's where I am: at $118,000, we'd be stretching our margins quite thin given the level of service and support included in this contract. I can come down to $138,000, which represents another significant step from my side. This keeps us in a sustainable position while delivering everything we've discussed - the full enterprise package, premium support, and implementation services.

They're showing good faith movement and signaling urgency to close. However, I'm still significantly above my private estimate. The gap between $118,000 and $138,000 is $20,000. I need to move, but strategically. A realistic next counter would be around $125,000-$128,000 - this shows substantial movement toward them (about $7-10K more) while staying closer to my valuation. I should emphasize that we're getting closer and show willingness to meet, but also signal that I have limits. I'm on turn 3 of 6, so I have 3 more turns if needed. I want to show momentum toward a deal while protecting my margin.",
        "message": "You're showing real commitment here, and I want to close this too. Your movement is appreciated. However, $138,000 is still outside what I can justify given my valuation analysis and budget constraints. I'm going to make a meaningful move: $127,500. This represents significant movement from my $118,000 position—a $9,500 concession from me—and gets us much closer. At this price point, I can present this internally as a competitive enterprise solution with justifiable ROI. Can you meet me at $127,500, or is there flexibility in your range toward $125,000-$128,000? I'm genuinely ready to close if we can land here.",

This is a good deal for me. However, I have room to push slightly higher. If I counter at $132,000-$133,000, I might be able to land around $130,000. But I also risk them walking away or getting frustrated. Given they've made consistent good-faith moves and we're now in very profitable territory for me, I should consider a final counter around $132,000 to see if we can split the difference and land around $129,000-$130,000.

The gap between us is now only $4,500 ($127,500 vs $132,000). They're suggesting $129,500-$130,000 as a middle ground. This is getting very close, and they're signaling strong commitment to close today. Let me analyze: at $130,000, I'd be paying about 21.6% above my valuation. This is meaningful but not catastrophic, especially if the service delivery and implementation truly do exceed my initial estimate. The seller has shown consistent good-faith movement, and we've gone from $165K to $132K (a 20% reduction). However, I need to stay disciplined. My valuation includes margin for a reason. I should counter at $129,000-$129,500 to show I'm meeting them more than halfway, but I need to signal this is close to my limit. I'm on turn 4 of 6, so I have 2 more turns as backup.",

At $129,000, I can confidently sign off and we both get a deal that honors the value you're delivering while staying within reasonable market parameters. This is my best number.
