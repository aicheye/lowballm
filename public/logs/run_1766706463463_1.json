        "message": "Hello! I'm excited to present this rare digital art NFT. This is a truly exceptional piece with significant artistic and collectible value. Given its rarity and the current market demand for quality digital art, I'm offering it at $18,500. This piece has strong potential for appreciation, and I believe this price reflects its true worth in today's market.",

I will start with an offer around $7,800, citing current market trends and comparable sales to justify the lower starting point.",
        "message": "Thank you for sharing this piece; it's definitely impressive. However, $18,500 is quite far from where I see the market value currently. Looking at recent sales of comparable digital art and the general cooling of the NFT market, I was looking to invest closer to $7,800. I believe this reflects a more realistic entry point for this specific asset today.",

I need to counter firmly but show some flexibility to keep them engaged. I'll come down from $18,500 but not too drastically - maybe to around $16,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining that I believe in the value of this piece.",
        "message": "I appreciate your interest and understand the market has seen some fluctuations. However, $7,800 significantly undervalues this particular piece. This isn't just any NFT - it's a rare work with documented provenance and artistic merit that sets it apart from the general market cooling you're referencing. I can come down to $16,500 as a gesture of good faith, but I need to stay firm on recognizing the true quality here. The rarity factor alone justifies a premium.",

I'll offer $8,900, which is a $1,100 increase from my previous offer, keeping me well below my ceiling.",
        "message": "I hear you on the provenance, and it's a great piece, but even with those factors, $16,500 is still substantially above the current trading range for items of this class. I’m willing to move up to $8,900 to reflect the quality you mentioned, but I have to remain disciplined with my budget given the liquidity risks in the current environment.",

I'm at $16,500 and they're at $8,900 - the gap is still large. I need to come down more substantially to show I'm serious about making a deal, but I absolutely cannot go below my valuation. Let me try coming down to around $14,000. This shows significant movement while keeping me in profitable territory. I have 4 turns left after this, so I still have room to negotiate.",
        "message": "I appreciate you moving up, and I can see you're serious about this piece. Let me be more flexible here - I can come down to $14,000. That's a significant reduction from my original ask. I understand liquidity concerns, but this piece has staying power precisely because of its rarity. Quality digital art with strong provenance tends to hold value better than the broader market. I think $14,000 is a fair middle ground that respects both the asset's quality and current market realities.",

        "message": "I appreciate the significant move to $14,000, and I recognize the quality of the piece. However, even at that price, it remains well above my internal valuation based on current secondary market data for similar works.

The gap is still $4,200 between us. Their $9,800 is still below my $11,835 valuation, so I cannot accept this. I have 3 turns left. I need to signal that I'm getting closer to my floor while still leaving room to negotiate. Let me come down to around $12,500. This keeps me above my valuation with some buffer and shows I'm making real moves toward a deal.",
        "message": "Thank you for stretching to $9,800 - I can see you're genuinely interested. Let me be direct with you: I've done considerable research on this piece and I know what it's worth. I can come down to $12,500, which is really pushing my limits. This is a premium asset and at $12,500 you're getting excellent value for something that will appreciate as the market stabilizes.

I will offer $10,600, which is a $800 increase from my previous offer, to see if they are willing to come under my limit.",

Their $10,600 offer is still below my $11,835 valuation, so I cannot accept it. I have 2 turns left after this one. I need to be strategic here. If I come down to around $11,900-$12,000, I'm just barely above my valuation. The buyer seems to be approaching their ceiling. Let me try $11,900 - this gives me a small margin above my valuation and signals I'm near my absolute floor. If they can't meet me closer to this, I may need to walk away.",
        "message": "I can see we're both working hard to make this happen. $10,600 is getting closer, but it's still below what I can accept for this piece. I'm going to be very transparent - I can go as low as $11,900. This is essentially my floor. At this price, you're getting a rare digital art piece at a very competitive rate, and I'm making minimal margin. If you can stretch to meet me near this number, we can close this deal today. Otherwise, I may need to hold onto this piece for a buyer who recognizes its full value.",

At $11,850, you're getting an exceptional piece at a price I honestly wouldn't offer to just anyone. This is my final number - if you can make it work, we have a deal.",

According to my instructions, it is better to walk away than to accept a deal that loses value. I will make one last mention of my cap, but as I cannot meet their price, I will not be accepting the deal.",
        "message": "I appreciate your final offer and the effort you've put into this negotiation. However, $11,850 is strictly above the absolute ceiling of my valuation for this piece.
