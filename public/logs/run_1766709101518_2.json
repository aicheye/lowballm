Given you can do immediate, no-contingency payment, I can move from my ask and make a firm counter at $25,000 for a clean close today.

Structure: $10,889 paid immediately on clean transfer + an on-chain, automated payout of 50% of any profit on the next resale within 24 months, capped at an additional $11,011 (so your maximum total receipt = $22,000). The upside payout is executed by smart contract on-chain (no off-chain enforcement, no contingencies to delay the close).
