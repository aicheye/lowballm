My private valuation is $51,588, but I need to aim significantly higher to leave room for negotiation while maximizing profit. Premium AI-related domains are highly valuable in the current market. I'll start with an ambitious but defensible price around 2.5-3x my valuation to anchor high. I'll open at $145,000 which gives substantial negotiation room while signaling this is a premium asset.",

This is an exceptional asset in today's AI-driven market - short, memorable, and perfectly positioned for the booming artificial intelligence sector.

I'll start with an offer around $12,000-15,000 to establish my position and leave room for negotiation while staying well below my maximum.",
        "message": "Thanks for reaching out about AI-Agent.com. While I appreciate the domain's relevance to the AI space, $145,000 is way beyond what the market supports for a two-word hyphenated domain. Hyphenated domains typically trade at a significant discount to their non-hyphenated counterparts. I've been tracking comparable sales, and I'd be willing to start the conversation at $14,000. That reflects a fair market value for a quality but hyphenated domain in this space.",

They're trying to anchor low by emphasizing the hyphen as a weakness. While it's true hyphenated domains trade at a discount, they're downplaying the value of the AI sector premium and the strong keyword combination. I need to defend my position strongly but show some flexibility. I should come down from $145,000 but stay well above my valuation. I'll counter at around $95,000, which still leaves substantial room for negotiation while signaling this domain is worth much more than their lowball offer. I need to reframe the conversation around the domain's strengths.",
        "message": "I appreciate your interest, but $14,000 significantly undervalues this asset. While I understand your point about hyphens, you're overlooking critical factors: 'AI-Agent' is a perfect, exact-match keyword combination for one of the hottest sectors in tech. The hyphen actually aids readability and SEO for this specific term. Companies are spending millions on AI agent technology - this domain provides instant brand credibility. Recent comparable AI domains have sold for 6 figures. I can move to $95,000, which reflects the true premium nature of this domain in the current market.

I need to push back firmly while showing some willingness to negotiate. I'll increase my offer modestly to show good faith, but stay well below my maximum. I'll move to around $19,000-20,000.",
        "message": "I appreciate you coming down, but $95,000 is still in a different stratosphere from where this domain should trade. Let me be direct - hyphenated domains rarely command premium prices regardless of the keywords. The SEO benefit you mention is marginal at best since Google has long moved past exact-match domain advantages. Most serious buyers looking for an AI agent brand would prefer AI-Agent without the hyphen or a different construction entirely. That said, I do see some value here and I'm willing to move up. I can offer $20,000, which I think is a fair price that accounts for the domain's relevance while being realistic about its limitations.",

At $20,000, I'd be losing over $31,000 in value relative to my estimate. This is unacceptable. They're being very aggressive in downplaying the domain's value. I need to hold firm but show I'm willing to negotiate seriously. I'm at turn 3 of 6, so I have time but need to move toward a realistic middle ground. I'll come down to around $72,000, which is still well above my valuation but shows significant movement.

        "message": "I understand your perspective, but $20,000 simply doesn't reflect market reality for this domain. You're focusing only on the hyphen while ignoring the explosive growth in AI agents - this is THE defining term for autonomous AI systems. Major companies are building entire platforms around this exact concept. While exact-match SEO has evolved, brandable, memorable domains in hot sectors absolutely command premiums. I'm willing to negotiate seriously and come down to $72,000. That's nearly half my opening price. But I need to see meaningful movement from your side as well - the gap between $20,000 and fair value is too wide to bridge with small increments.",

I can go to $27,000. That's a 35% increase from my last offer and represents serious money for a hyphenated domain. Look, I'm genuinely interested in this domain for a project I'm working on, but I have budget constraints that are real. The hype around AI agents is strong today, but domain values need to reflect sustainable worth, not peak-cycle speculation. At $27,000, I'm paying a premium for the keyword relevance while staying grounded in what hyphenated domains actually trade for. Can we find common ground somewhere in this range?",

I'm at turn 4 of 6, so I have 2 more turns after this. I need to signal that we're getting close to my walk-away point. They mentioned budget constraints, which could be genuine or a negotiating tactic. I should make one more significant move to around $58,000-60,000 (just above my valuation) to test if they're serious. If they can't get into the $45,000+ range, I should prepare to walk away since no deal is better than losing value.",

This domain has substantial intrinsic value beyond just the current AI hype cycle. I'm willing to make one more substantial move to $58,000. This is close to my floor, and honestly, it's already a very competitive price for a premium AI domain.
