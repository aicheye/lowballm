I'll aim for around $21,500-$22,000 as my opening offer, which gives us room to meet somewhere in the middle that works for me.",
        "message": "Thanks for the details. I've been researching the market pretty thoroughly and have seen similar 2020 Model 3s going for less in my area. I'm looking for a straightforward cash deal with a quick close - no financing complications. Given the age and typical depreciation, I'd be comfortable starting at $21,800.

Mileage is ~48k and it’s in very good condition: clean title, no warning lights, no mechanical issues, battery/drive unit performing normally, and the interior is clean with only minor normal wear. Tires/brakes are in good shape and it’s never been in a major accident. At $21,800 I’m too far apart—those numbers tend to be higher-mileage or with condition/history compromises. For a clean, quick cash deal on this one, I can come down to **$25,400**. If you’re close to that range, we can set up a time for you to see it and I’ll have the title ready.",

The car sounds like it's in good condition with reasonable mileage at 48k. I need to push harder to get below my valuation. I should counter with something around $23,200-$23,500 to keep the negotiation moving and signal I'm serious but need a better price. This gives us room to potentially meet around $24,000-$24,300 which would be a good deal for me.",
        "message": "Good to hear about the condition - 48k miles is reasonable and the clean history is definitely a plus. I appreciate you coming down, but $25,400 is still a bit rich for my budget. Looking at recent private party sales for similar specs, I'm seeing them close in the low $23k range. I can come up to $23,300 for a quick cash close this week. That's a fair price for both of us given the market. Would that work for you?",

If I counter at around $23,800-$24,000, we might be able to meet around $24,100-$24,200, which would give me a better buffer below my valuation.

The seller has been reasonable throughout, moving from $26,900 down to $24,200. I could try to push for a bit more, but there's a risk they hold firm or walk away.
