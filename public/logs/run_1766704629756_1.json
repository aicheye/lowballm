A 2020 Tesla Model 3 in good condition typically sells for $25,000-$35,000 depending on mileage and condition. I'll start high at $32,000 to give myself room to negotiate down while still staying well above my minimum.",
        "message": "Hello! I'm excited to offer this well-maintained 2020 Tesla Model 3. It's been a fantastic vehicle - smooth performance, great range, and all the Tesla tech features you'd expect. I'm asking $32,000 for it, which I believe is very fair given the current market and the condition of this car. Are you interested?",

This is a typical opening move - they're starting high to leave room for negotiation. I need to counter with a lower offer that's below my valuation but not so low that it seems unrealistic. I'll start around $24,000 to anchor the negotiation lower and give myself room to move up while staying well below my $27,171 limit. This is turn 1 of 6, so I have time to negotiate.",
        "message": "Thanks for reaching out! I've been looking at the market for 2020 Model 3s, and while your car sounds nice, $32,000 is quite a bit higher than what I'm seeing for similar vehicles. Considering the depreciation and current market conditions, I'd be willing to start the conversation at $24,000. What do you think?",

However, this is only the first counter-offer and I have room to negotiate higher. The midpoint between $32,000 and $24,000 is $28,000. I should counter with something that moves toward them but still keeps me well above my minimum. I'll come down to $29,500 - showing flexibility while maintaining a strong position.",
        "message": "I appreciate your interest and the reasonable starting point! You're right that the market has shifted, but this particular Model 3 has been exceptionally well-maintained with a clean history and good battery health. I can come down a bit - how about $29,500? That reflects the quality of this specific vehicle while acknowledging your market research.",

I need to counter closer to my target but still leave room for one more negotiation round if needed. I'll move up to $25,500 - this shows I'm willing to negotiate but keeps me well below my limit. This is turn 2 of 6, so I still have room to maneuver.",
        "message": "I appreciate you coming down on the price. The maintenance history is definitely a plus. However, $29,500 is still higher than I'm comfortable with given what similar 2020 Model 3s are selling for in the current market. I can go up to $25,500. That's a fair offer that reflects the value while acknowledging the car's condition.",

They're at $25,500 which is $2,584 above my private valuation, so I'm in profitable territory. But I think there's still room to push higher. The midpoint between our current positions ($29,500 and $25,500) is $27,500.

I think $27,500 is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",

While I'd ideally like to pay less, this is actually a reasonable deal - I'd still be getting value since it's close to my estimate. However, I should try one more counter to see if I can get it below my valuation. I'll offer $26,500, which is $671 below my limit. This gives me room to accept if they counter at around $27,000 or slightly above. This is turn 3 of 6, so I still have negotiating room.",

We're on turn 4 of 6, so I have a couple more turns. I could try to push for $27,000 as a split-the-difference compromise, or accept $26,500.

The seller has been reasonable and moved significantly from their opening of $32,000. At $27,000, I'm saving $171 relative to my valuation, which is a win.
