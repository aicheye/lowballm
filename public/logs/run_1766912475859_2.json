I'll start with a significantly lower offer to set expectations and work toward a price well under my valuation. I'll mention market conditions and comparable prices to justify my position.",
        "message": "Hi! Thanks for the details on the iPhone. While I appreciate that it's been well cared for, $1,050 is quite steep for a used iPhone 13 Pro Max in today's market. I've seen similar models going for much less, especially with the newer iPhone 15 series out now. I'd be willing to offer $420 for it, including the accessories you mentioned. Let me know what you think.",

I need to firmly reject this while explaining why the value remains high. I will lower my price slightly to $960 to show I am willing to negotiate, but I must maintain a high anchor to protect my margin.",
        "message": "I appreciate the offer, but $420 is unfortunately far too low for a Pro Max model in this condition. Even with the iPhone 15 out, the 13 Pro Max remains highly sought after for its incredible battery life and ProMotion display. Given that this unit is in mint condition with all original accessories, the lowest I could consider right now is $960. That's a fair price for a premium device that has been treated this well.",

I need to move up from my $420 offer but stay conservative to leave room for further negotiation. I'll increase to around $480-500 to show I'm serious but maintain pressure. I should emphasize market realities and that used phones depreciate significantly.",
        "message": "I understand you've taken great care of it, and I do appreciate that. However, the market for used phones has shifted significantly with newer models available. Even mint condition 13 Pro Max units are selling in the $450-550 range on most resale platforms. I can come up to $485, which I think is fair given current market conditions. The accessories are nice but don't add substantial value since most buyers already have cables and cases.",

Their claim that mint 13 Pro Max units sell for $450-$550 is quite low for the Pro Max variant in pristine condition. I need to stand my ground on the quality of the device while showing some flexibility to keep the negotiation alive. I will lower my offer to $895, which is a $65 reduction from my previous price, but still maintains a healthy margin above my floor.",
        "message": "I understand your perspective, but $485 is more reflective of a standard iPhone 13 or a Pro model with significant wear. The Pro Max, especially in mint condition with high battery health, still holds a much higher value due to the display and battery performance. I'm willing to be flexible to find a middle ground, so I can lower my price to $895. This is a great deal for a phone that is essentially like new.",

I need to make a meaningful move upward to show good faith but stay well under my valuation. I'll go to around $530-550. I should emphasize that even 'like new' used phones have significant depreciation and that my offer is reasonable for the current market.",
        "message": "I appreciate you coming down, but $895 is still quite a bit higher than what the market supports for this model. Look, I want to make a deal here, so I'll move up to $540. That's a solid offer for a used device, even one in great condition. Keep in mind that any used phone carries some risk for the buyer - no warranty, unknown long-term battery degradation, etc. I think $540 is a fair middle ground.",

I will drop my price to $835 to signal I'm moving toward a deal, but I'm nearing my limit. I need to defend my margin as per the instructions.",
        "message": "I appreciate your offer, but $540 is still significantly below the actual market value for a mint 13 Pro Max. In fact, professional resale sites and trade-in programs often offer considerably more than that for this specific model in pristine condition. To show I'm serious about closing a deal today, I can come down to $835. This is a very fair price for a premium device with a perfect screen and high battery health.",

My valuation is $631, so I need to stay under that. I should make a more substantial move to show I'm serious about closing, but I can't go above my valuation. Let me offer around $580-590 to show good faith while leaving room for one more round. I need to signal that I'm getting close to my limit.",

I can stretch to $585, which is a significant jump from my last offer. That's genuinely where I'm getting close to my ceiling.

If they don't make a massive jump in the next turn, I will have to walk away as per the instructions to not accept a deal below my valuation.",
        "message": "I appreciate your transparency regarding your budget, but $585 is unfortunately not a price I can accept for a Pro Max in this condition. Even the base trade-in values for this model are well above that. I'm willing to meet you partway to get this done quickly today, so I'll drop my price to $810.

The gap is still huge - I'm at $585, they're at $810. My max is $631, and I need to stay under that. I should make my final serious push, going to around $615-620 to show I'm at my limit while still leaving some margin under my valuation. If they can't come close to this, I'll need to walk away. I need to be very clear this is near my absolute maximum.",
