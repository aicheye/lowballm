        "message": "Thanks for your interest in my 2020 Tesla Model 3. It’s been well cared for and is in solid shape. I’m asking $27,900, which is competitive for a clean 2020 Model 3 in good condition. Happy to provide records, allow an inspection/test drive, and answer any questions. What matters most to you—price, mileage, features, or charging accessories? Do you have a target budget or timeline in mind?",

Offer $20,500 cash, contingent on inspection/title check — this gives me ~$2k buffer under my valuation for repairs/holding costs and negotiation room. Ask for key facts (mileage, trim, Autopilot/FSD, accidents, VIN, service records, location) and emphasize quick, cash close to make offer attractive. Keep tone polite and firm; say deal is contingent on inspection and clear title. Do not accept seller price.",
        "message": "Thanks — I care most about price, mileage, and service history. Before we dive further: what's the odometer reading, trim (Standard/Long Range/Performance), included options (Autopilot/FSD), tire condition, any accidents or title issues, and can you share the VIN and service records? Where is the car located and is a test drive/inspection possible this week? \n\nBased on current market comps and allowing for inspection and any minor repairs, I'm prepared to do a fast, cash purchase contingent on a clean inspection and title for $20,500. I can close within a few days if everything checks out. If that’s too low, tell me what your absolute bottom looks like and any positives I should factor in (low miles, paid-for FSD, recent battery/tyre work, etc.).",

I’ll drop from $27,900 to $26,500 to signal flexibility without giving up margin, invite inspection, and ask them to move significantly upward. Avoid revealing absolute bottom; hint that offers in the low 20s won’t work.",
        "message": "Appreciate the detail and the quick-close offer. Here are the specifics:\n- Trim: 2020 Model 3 Long Range AWD\n- Odometer: 48,2xx miles\n- Title/accidents: Clean title, no accidents, no paintwork, no open recalls\n- Options: Basic Autopilot included (no FSD). Premium interior. Two key cards.\n- Tires/brakes: Michelin CrossClimate 2s installed ~3 months ago (8/32” tread). Brakes in great shape (regen-heavy use).\n- Battery/health: 12V battery replaced in 2023; cabin filters 2024; alignment 2024. At 90% charge it shows ~275 miles; battery/drive unit warranty good to 2028 or 120k miles.\n- Charging/accessories: Gen 2 Mobile Connector with 5-15 and 14-50 adapters, plus J1772 adapter and all-weather mats.\n- Records/VIN: Full service and tire records available. VIN: 5YJ3E1EB5LF123456.\n- Location/inspection: San Jose, CA. Test drive and third‑party or Tesla service inspection are fine this week.\n\n$20,500 won’t work given it’s a clean LR AWD with fresh tires and records. I’m at $26,500 contingent on a clean inspection and title. Cash/fast close is appreciated, but the market value here is solid. If you’re serious and can move up substantially, we can likely find a number that works. What’s your best number assuming the inspection is clean?",

The car has good points (LR AWD, clean title, warranty to 2028, recent maintenance, good tires) but also factors that pull value down for me: ~48k miles, no FSD (reduces resale/value), battery at ~90% (OK but not perfect), and market/headroom for inspections/repairs/taxes. I need to stay below my valuation. Offer a firm, clean cash number that’s attractive because of speed/certainty but protects my margin: $22,000 contingent on clean inspection/title and review of service/vehicle history. Be polite, show willingness to close fast, request Carfax/service records and timing for inspection/test drive. Keep negotiation room small but defend the number.",

I can be in San Jose within 48 hours to test drive and close immediately if everything checks out. If that works, tell me when’s good for inspection/test drive and please send the vehicle history report.
