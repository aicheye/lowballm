Premium domain names like 'AI-Agent.com' are highly valuable in today's AI-focused market. I should start high to leave room for negotiation while anchoring expectations. I'll open at $125,000 which gives me significant room to negotiate down while still staying well above my minimum.",
        "message": "Hello! I'm excited to discuss the sale of AI-Agent.com - a truly premium domain name that's perfectly positioned for the booming AI industry. This is a short, memorable, keyword-rich domain that immediately communicates authority in the AI agent space. Companies are paying top dollar for domains like this. I'm offering it at $125,000, which reflects its strategic value in today's market. What are your thoughts?",

This is a common negotiation tactic - starting very high to anchor the discussion. I need to counter with a much lower offer to establish my own anchor point, but it should still be reasonable enough to keep the negotiation going. I'll start at around 30-35% of their asking price, which is a typical opening counter in domain negotiations. This gives me room to negotiate upward while staying well below my maximum. I should acknowledge the domain's value to maintain rapport but firmly establish a lower price range.",
        "message": "Thank you for reaching out! I agree that AI-Agent.com is a solid domain name with good keyword relevance. However, $125,000 is well beyond what I can justify for this purchase. The AI domain market has seen significant speculation, and I need to be prudent with my investment. I'm interested, but I'd be looking at something in the range of $35,000 to make this work for my budget and business case. Would you be willing to consider an offer in that range?",

I should counter at a price that's still strong but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'll come down to around $95,000 - a meaningful reduction that signals good faith while keeping plenty of room above my minimum.",
        "message": "I appreciate your interest and understand the need to be prudent with investments. However, $35,000 significantly undervalues this asset. Consider that 'AI-Agent.com' is a two-word, highly brandable domain in what's arguably the hottest tech sector right now. Comparable AI-related domains have sold for six figures. That said, I want to work with you here. I can come down to $95,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its market potential and the competitive advantage it would give your business.

However, $95,000 is still more than double my private valuation of $43,889. I need to move up from my $35,000 offer to show good faith and keep the negotiation alive, but I must stay well below my maximum. I'll increase to around $42,000-$43,000, which is close to my limit but leaves me a tiny bit of room. This is a significant jump from my side (about 20% increase) and should demonstrate serious intent. I'm now at turn 2 of 6, so I have room to negotiate but need to be strategic.",
        "message": "I appreciate you coming down, and I can see you're serious about making a deal.

I can stretch my budget to $42,000, which represents a significant increase from my initial offer and reflects the genuine value I see in the domain.

However, I need to be equally transparent: AI-Agent.com is a premium asset that I've held specifically because of its exceptional value in this market. Domains with this kind of keyword alignment and brandability don't come around often. I've already made a significant move from my opening price. I can come down to $78,000, but I need you to understand this is a substantial concession on my end. This domain will be worth multiples of this in the coming years as AI agents become mainstream.

I'm at turn 3 of 6, so I have 3 more turns to work with. I need to signal that I'm near my absolute maximum. I could go to my full $43,889 or slightly below to leave minimal negotiation room.

I need to be completely honest with you - $78,000 simply doesn't work for me from a ROI perspective. I've analyzed what I can realistically recoup from this investment, and I'm already at the edge of my feasible range. I can go to $44,000 as my final position.

I need to make a strong counter that's close to my minimum but still gives me some margin. I'll offer $58,000 - this is just above my valuation of $56,381, giving me a small profit while being my most aggressive offer yet.
