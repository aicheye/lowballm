AI-Agent.com is a premium, exact-match brandable domain in the fast-growing AI/agent space — highly relevant for startups, enterprise AI products, and marketplaces. Given the market demand for memorable AI domains and recent category sales, I’m asking $120,000. The name is ready for immediate transfer and I’m prioritizing serious buyers.

        "message": "Thanks for the details on AI-Agent.com. While it's a decent domain, the AI space is getting crowded with alternatives and many startups are opting for creative variations rather than paying premium prices for exact-match domains. I've been tracking similar sales and see a lot of variability in actual closing prices versus asking prices. I'm a serious buyer with funds ready, but I'd need to be at $28,000 to make this work for my budget. Let me know if we can find common ground.",

I’m willing to move substantially from my initial asking price to find common ground. My counter: $75,000 for AI-Agent.com. To make a quick, low-friction close I can accept $70,000 if you’re ready to pay immediately via a secure Escrow.com or wire transfer. The domain is clean, transferable today, and I’ll include standard transfer support.

I've done my homework on comparable sales, and while AI-Agent.com is solid, the hyphen does limit some of its premium appeal compared to non-hyphenated alternatives. I can move up meaningfully to $40,000 with immediate payment via Escrow.com - I'm ready to close this week if we can agree. This is a real, actionable offer from a motivated buyer.

I want to make this work for both of us. My final, firm price for an immediate close via Escrow.com is $68,000. If you can fund Escrow today and confirm, I’ll initiate the transfer process and provide full transfer support until the domain is delivered. I can hold the domain off-market for 48 hours while Escrow is funded. If $68,000 won’t work, please make your best and final realistic offer now — otherwise I’ll need to move on.

I should make a more substantial move to show I'm serious, but cap it well below my limit. I'll go to $48,000-$50,000. This shows significant movement from $40k while keeping me safe.

Let me be direct: $68k doesn't work for my budget, but I want to find a number that respects the domain's value while being realistic for what I can pay. I'm prepared to go to $50,000 as my best serious offer with immediate Escrow.com funding. That's a $22k jump from where I started and represents real money on the table today.
