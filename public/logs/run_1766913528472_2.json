Start at $2,200 to leave room for concessions while staying well above my valuation. Signal willingness to negotiate but not desperation.",
        "message": "Thanks for your interest — I’m selling a high-end road bicycle in excellent condition. Quick highlights: carbon frame, Shimano Ultegra groupset, new tires and brake pads within the last 200 miles, recent full tune and inspection, low overall mileage, and original MSRP around $3,500. It rides like new and has been garage-kept with all service receipts available. I’m asking $2,200. I believe that’s fair given the components and condition, but I’m open to reasonable offers — let me know if you’d like more photos, service records, or to set up a test ride.",

        "thought": "The seller is asking $2,200 for a bike I value at $1,485. That's a significant gap. I need to start low to give myself room to negotiate upward while staying well under my valuation. The bike sounds nice, but I should anchor low - maybe around $1,100-1,200 to leave room for back and forth. I'll express interest but make clear the asking price is too high for me.",
        "message": "Thanks for the detailed description - the Ultegra groupset and carbon frame are definitely appealing, and it sounds like you've taken good care of it. However, $2,200 is quite a bit more than I was looking to spend. Given the used market for similar bikes and my budget, I could offer $1,150. I know that's a significant difference from your ask, but I'm a serious buyer if we can find common ground.",

        "thought": "Buyer’s $1,150 is below my private estimate ($1,191) so I must reject it. Keep a firm, reasonable counter that defends my margin but leaves room to concede later. Emphasize value (components, recent service, low miles, MSRP) and add a small incentive (included accessory or quick pickup) to justify a higher price. Anchor at $1,800 — well above my estimate but below initial $2,200 — signaling willingness to negotiate while protecting value.",
        "message": "I appreciate the offer and that you’re a serious buyer, but $1,150 is below what I can accept. This bike just had a full tune, new wear items (tires, brake pads) recently, and the Ultegra carbon setup with low miles is in great shape — comparable listings with similar specs and service tend to sit higher. I can do $1,800 and I’ll include a recent service receipt and a pair of clipless pedals so you can ride away immediately. I’m available for a test ride or to meet this week if that helps. If that’s out of range, let me know your best next offer.",

I need to move up from my $1,150 offer to show good faith, but not too much. I'll go to around $1,300 - that's a $150 increase showing I'm serious, but keeps me well under my max. The pedals are a nice throw-in but don't change the math significantly.",
        "message": "I appreciate you coming down and the offer to include the pedals - that's a nice touch. I understand you've invested in maintenance, but even well-maintained used bikes depreciate significantly from MSRP. I can come up to $1,300. That reflects what I'm seeing for comparable Ultegra carbon bikes in the used market. I'm flexible on timing and can meet whenever works for you if we can get closer on price.",

Concede from $1,800 down to a firm, fair middle ground that still beats my estimate by a healthy margin. Present $1,495 as my best and final offer, include the pedals and service receipt to add tangible value, and signal readiness to complete the sale quickly to push toward agreement.",
        "message": "Thanks — I appreciate you moving up and your flexibility on timing. $1,300 is fair given the market, but between the recent full service, new wear items, the Ultegra carbon build, and the included receipts I think the bike is worth a bit more. I can meet you at $1,495 and I’ll include the clipless pedals and the recent service receipt so you can ride it away immediately. That’s my best and final price — I can meet this week and prefer cash or bank transfer at pickup. Let me know if you’d like to finalize.",

If I accept at $1,495, I'd be paying $10 more than my valuation, which means a slight loss. The rules say it's better to walk away than accept a bad deal. However, the difference is minimal. Let me try one more counter - if I can get them to $1,450 or even $1,475, I'd be solidly under my valuation and getting a decent deal. I'll counter at $1,425 to see if we can meet somewhere in the $1,450 range.",

Propose a small final concession to $1,450 (still a healthy margin over my estimate) with pedals and service receipt included and emphasize quick pickup to close the sale.",
