        "message": "Thanks for the proposal. We've been evaluating several enterprise SaaS options in this space, and while your platform has strong features, $165,000 is significantly above what we've budgeted and what we're seeing from competitive offerings. We're looking at approximately 75-100 seats with standard compliance needs (SOC 2 Type II). Given the competitive landscape and our budget constraints, we'd be looking at something closer to $112,000 annually to make this work. What flexibility do you have on pricing?",

        "message": "At 75–100 seats with SOC 2 Type II and enterprise controls (SSO/SAML, audit logs, RBAC) plus priority support, $112,000/year isn’t workable for us—it’s below where we can sustainably deliver the enterprise package. That said, we do have flexibility depending on structure. For a 12‑month term at 75–100 seats, I can come down to **$149,000/year** including the enterprise security features, onboarding, and priority support. If you have room to help us on terms, we can sharpen further—for example: - **Annual prepay** and/or - a **24‑month commitment** Share what matters most (lowest year-1 price vs. flexibility on term/seat minimum), and I’ll put the most aggressive option on the table.",

I should counter more aggressively but show some flexibility. I can offer annual prepay as a concession to get a better price. Let me counter around $120,000-125,000 with annual prepay to show I'm serious but still protect my margin.",
        "message": "I appreciate the movement and the transparency on what levers matter to you. We can definitely do annual prepay upfront - that's standard for us and reduces your collection risk. However, $149,000 is still a stretch for our budget. Competitive solutions we're evaluating are coming in at the $115,000-$125,000 range with similar enterprise features. With annual prepay and a commitment to 75 seats minimum, I can go to $122,000. That's a meaningful increase from our initial position and accounts for the prepay benefit. We're motivated to close this quickly if the numbers work.",

        "message": "Annual prepay and a 75-seat minimum definitely helps—thank you. At $122,000, we’d be pricing this essentially at a mid-market level while still delivering the enterprise package and support. If you’re motivated to close quickly, here’s a structure I *can* get approved: - **$136,000/year** (annual prepay) - **85-seat minimum** (you can deploy up to 100 without a re-rate) - Includes **SSO/SAML, RBAC, audit logs, SOC 2 Type II alignment**, priority support + SLA, and onboarding - **Price hold on year 2** if you renew on time (no uplift) If you need to stay closer to your number, the only way I could approach it would be with a **24-month commitment** (still annual prepay). If that’s on the table, tell me and I’ll price that option out.",

The 85-seat minimum is a bit higher than I mentioned (75), but the price hold on year 2 has some value. I should push back a bit more - either get them below $134k on the 12-month deal, or explore the 24-month option if it gets me a better per-year rate. Let me counter at $128,000 for the 12-month or ask what the 24-month pricing would be. I'll try to get them to $130,000 or below on the single year.",
        "message": "We're getting closer. The 85-seat minimum works for us, and the year 2 price hold is a nice add. At $136,000 we're still slightly above where I can get internal approval without escalation. I can commit to the 85-seat minimum with annual prepay at $130,000 and close this week. That's an $8,000 move from my last position and reflects the value of the enterprise package you're offering. Alternatively, if the 24-month commitment gets us to a materially better rate, I'm open to hearing that number - but it would need to be compelling given the longer lock-in. What can you do?",

If you can execute by EOW with annual prepay and an 85-seat minimum, I can do **$133,000/year** with: - Enterprise security (SSO/SAML, RBAC, audit logs) - SOC 2 Type II alignment - Priority support + SLA - Onboarding - Year-2 price hold (no uplift) On the 24-month option: with a 2-year commitment (annual prepay), I could get you to **$128,000/year**—but given you’re already ready to close this week, I think the cleanest path is $133,000 on a 12‑month term.

        "thought": "Excellent progress. They've offered two options: 1. 12-month at $133,000 - this is below my valuation of $134,659, so I'd save $1,659 2. 24-month at $128,000/year - this is $6,659 below my valuation per year, saving $13,318 over 2 years Both are acceptable deals since they're below my private valuation. The 24-month option gives me better per-year savings but locks me in longer. However, I should try one more push to see if I can get the 12-month deal down to $130,000 or the 24-month to $125,000. But I'm also at risk of losing a good deal if I push too hard. The $133,000 for 12-month is a fair deal - I'm paying less than my valuation. The $128,000 for 24-month is even better per year. Let me try to get the 12-month to $131,000 or accept the 24-month at $128,000. Actually, the 24-month at $128k is a really good deal - $6,659 under valuation per year. I should probably take that or make one small push.",
        "message": "Both options are in the right zone. The 24-month commitment at $128,000/year is compelling - that's a meaningful discount for the extended lock-in. Before I confirm, can you do $126,000/year on the 24-month? That would make the 2-year commitment an easy yes for me internally given the longer obligation. If $126k works, I'll confirm the 24-month route and we can get the order form moving today.",
