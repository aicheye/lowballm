Ask a competitive market price that’s believable for a well-maintained 2020 Model 3 so buyer doesn’t walk immediately—$34,500 gives ~9.6k room to negotiate. I’ll highlight condition and features to justify premium and signal I’m open but not desperate. Reserve (minimum I'll accept) should be comfortably above my valuation; internally set around $26,500–$27,500, but don’t reveal it yet. Keep tone professional and invite a concrete offer.",

That said, $34,500 is well above what I’m seeing for 2020 Model 3s given current depreciation and incentives on newer inventory. If everything checks out (clean title, no accidents, battery/charging healthy), I can do $19,500 and can move quickly with a straightforward purchase.

Battery and charging are healthy and I’ll provide the diagnostic and CarFax so you can verify. Comparable clean 2020 Model 3s in similar condition are selling significantly higher than $19,500. I’m willing to move quickly for a serious buyer: my counter is $30,000.
