Start with a confident, justifiable anchor that highlights rarity, provenance, and potential upside. I'll propose $28,000 — a strong anchor but not absurd for rare NFT collectors. I plan to concede in measured steps if needed but will not accept anything at or below my private estimate; my minimum acceptable price should stay above $13,835 (target minimum ~ $14,500–$16,000 if pressed). Keep tone professional and invite offers/counteroffers.",
        "message": "Thanks for stopping by — I’m offering a one-of-a-kind, on-chain rare digital art NFT with verified provenance, early-creator pedigree, and exclusive unlockable content (high-resolution file + personalized certificate). This piece has been featured in curated drops and has clear comparables that traded significantly higher than floor. Given its scarcity and demonstrable demand, I’m listing it at $28,000. I’m open to reasonable offers and can accommodate secure on-chain payment or escrow. If you’re genuinely interested, tell me what you have in mind and we’ll work toward a deal.",

Offer $8,500 with strong terms (fast close, cover fees) and request light due diligence. Signal flexibility within a tight band without committing above my ceiling.",
        "message": "Appreciate the background and the unlockables. I’m a ready buyer and can close quickly. Given current liquidity, volatility, and the variance on 1/1 realized prices vs. list, my cash offer is $8,500 all-in. I’ll cover gas and standard escrow, and can fund same-day once I’ve seen: contract address/token ID to verify provenance, a watermark preview of the high-res, and confirmation of the rights (personal display vs. commercial). If comps genuinely support higher, feel free to share them, but I’m realistically in the high–single to low–five figures depending on rights and condition.

Offer a premium for full commercial rights and a lower (but still >valuation) price for personal-display-only to give buyer a choice and room to concede. Commit to immediate provenance and watermarked preview to facilitate quick close, but hold firm on price bands. Aim to steer toward $19,500 (full rights) or $16,500 (personal use).",
        "message": "I appreciate the quick-faith offer and the readiness to close — that helps. However $8,500 is too low relative to proven demand for this 1/1 and the clear unlockables and provenance tied to it. I can move, but I need to stay well above my valuation. Here are my firm options: \n\n- $19,500 — full transfer of the NFT plus explicit commercial/display rights (you can monetize, license, or exhibit commercially). Immediate settlement via escrow accepted. \n- $16,500 — NFT transfer with personal/display rights only (no commercial licensing). Immediate settlement via escrow accepted. \n\nIf you accept either option I will send the contract address and token ID and a watermarked high-res preview right away for verification; full-resolution files and the written rights transfer will be delivered on escrow-confirmed payment. If neither of those fits, make a counter within that band and we’ll try to bridge it — but I can’t accept $8,500. Which option works for you?",

I’ll offer $12,000 for personal/display rights with strong, fast-close terms and cover fees to make it attractive. I’ll hint at a stretch option for commercial rights but keep my official offer at $12,000 to preserve room. Do not accept anything above my ceiling.",
        "message": "Thanks for laying out clear options. I respect the provenance and unlockables, but at today’s 1/1 realized prices and current liquidity, I can’t justify $16.5k–$19.5k. Here’s a clean, ready-to-close counter: $12,000 all-in for the NFT with personal/display rights. I’ll cover gas and standard escrow, fund same day upon verification of contract address + token ID, a watermarked high-res preview, and a short rights letter (personal/display only). We can sign the rights grant and I’m fine acknowledging your creator attribution in any displays. If commercial rights are essential on your side, the best I can realistically stretch to is $13,500 all-in with the same terms, but my formal offer today is $12,000 for personal/display. If your comps support higher, I’m open to reviewing them, but this reflects firm market risk on my end. My $12,000 stands 48 hours with immediate settlement.",

I should concede from my earlier anchors but stay above valuation and leave room to negotiate one more time. Present two firm, credible options (personal vs commercial) closer to buyer’s range but still profitable: center the primary counter at $15,000 for personal/display and give a commercial-rights price at $17,500. Offer immediate verification (contract address, token ID, watermarked preview) once buyer confirms intent to those terms and reiterate escrow/same-day funding. Keep window reasonable (48 hours) and invite quick close.",
        "message": "Thanks — I appreciate the clarity and willingness to close quickly. I can’t accept $12,000 (or $13,500) as those sit below my valuation. That said, I’m motivated to move this across the line for a serious buyer who can fund quickly. Final, firm options are: \n\n- $15,000 — NFT transfer with personal/display rights only (no commercial licensing). I will provide contract address + token ID and a watermarked high-res preview as soon as you confirm intent; full-resolution files and the signed rights letter will be delivered to escrow on confirmation of payment. You cover gas and standard escrow fees. \n\n- $17,500 — NFT transfer with full commercial/display rights (you may license or monetize). Same delivery/escrow process as above. \n\nBoth offers are all-in regarding the sale price (you cover gas/escrow separately) and I’ll hold either for 48 hours. If you’re ready, tell me which option you accept and I’ll send contract info and the preview immediately so you can verify provenance and move funds to escrow the same day.",
